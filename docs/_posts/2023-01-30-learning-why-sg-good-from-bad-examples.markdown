This is a non-technical post.

A few years ago I was sitting in a jazz cafe, when a group of young saxophone players started a jam session.  The players were young and seemingly at the beginning of their studies, so most of their solos were obviously not very good.  As if there's basically any kind of music around, I usually can't help focussing on it, I stopped reading and took my full attention to them.  After a while, I recognized something interesting: while in most cases it's quite difficult to explain why a good solo is good, it's almost always very obvious why a crap solo is crap.  Moreover, as crap solos often lack (or sometimes, conversely, over-exaggerate) some important attributes of good solos, you can actually learn a lot about good solos if you listen to some crap solos.  So if you want to understand why a John Coltrane solo is good, you shouldn't only listen to him or Charlie Parker, but also some folks who play really poorly.

Yeah, that's nice but this is (mostly) a tech blog.  How does this apply to tech?  In fact, what reminded me of this story is the book "SQL Antipatterns" by Bill Karwin.  I think this is a fantastic book, and a significant part of why I love it is because of its approach where not only does he present best practices (good solos), but he explains the reasons behind his choices through the lense of anti-patterns (crap solos).  And similarly to jazz, if you study some bad choices first (and it's much easier to explain (from the writer's point of you) and hence understand (from the reader's point of you) the consequences of bad choices than the non-consequences of good choices), you'll appreaciate the good patterns even more.

I think this didactic approach is most useful at areas that aren't as clear cut as, say, algorithms or how you write a for loop in a given programming language.  Software architecture, for example, is a more nuanced area, where feedback for wrong choices often only come months, even years later, so you need to gain experience before you really start to appreciate architectural best practices.  With studying anti-patterns, you may be able to speed up this learning curve.  Agile practices and transitioning to agile are also similarly good candidates.  (I've just checked and there are a lot of results for "agile antipatterns", but unfortunately they are mostly marketing materials.  (By which I didn't mean to comment on their quality, they're just for a different purpose.))

So, should you throw your good old Gang of Four book into the waste basket?  Definitely, no.  At the end of the day, you'll want play the saxophone like Sonny Rollins or Dexter Gordon. Similarly, with gaining more and more experience, you'll find re-reading it more and more useful (though I probably wouldn't recommend it as your first book in the topic).

But I think there's an even more interesting use case for it: read it as a case study of gaps-and-problems-with-OOP-that-need-to-be-resolved-by-unintuitive-programming-practices.  Which is, well, kind of an anti-patterns in programming language design approach..  But this will be the story of a different post.
