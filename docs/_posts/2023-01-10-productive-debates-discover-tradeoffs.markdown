This is a non-technical post.

vim or emacs, dynamically typed vs. statically typed languages, microservices
vs. monoliths, etc.

Can you could continue the list?  I guess so!  What's common in these debates is that there never is a clear winner, and easily become boring once the arguments become repetitive.  I think we lose an opportunity to learn something if we do it this way.

In my experience, if you have to choose a solution to a problem, if any of the options is clearly better than the others, people will find it and reach an agreement fairly quickly. Conversely, if you find yourselves debating between (typically) two options for several minutes (hours), it usually tells you that (i) none of the options is significantly better than the other, (ii) there's a trade-off somewhere.

And the sooner you recognize this, the sooner you can turn the debate from an unproductive us-against-them discussion to a more productive collective effort to discover what exactly is the trade-off between the options, which is a very useful learning exercise. (I found that in many cases better familiarity with one of the options takes a big part of the trade-off.  I'll write about it in another post.)

OK, cool, but at the end of the day, you'll need to pick one of the options, and even if people now understand what's going on, they'll still have different opinions.  How can this be resolved?

I think this is exactly what values are for: well-phrased values also represent trade-offs themselves, so choose the option that fits your values better. So, dynamically or statically typed languages? What's more important for you: faster feedback loops or the avoidance of certain types of runtime errors?
