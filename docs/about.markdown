I've been in the software world for more than 20 years, and I had a chance to
contribute in various aspects of creating software products from coding to software architecture to product management (in a -- now I
know -- quite naive way) to project management (in which I failed multiple times)
to management with a mandate to build a new development team from scratch to driving the
transformation of workflows from waterfall to agile to writing testing
strategies.

I'm also infamous for shamelessly eating the last piece of any kind of sweets available in any
meeting room.
